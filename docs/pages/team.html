          <h3>Silas Reinagel</h3>​
          <p>Silas Reinagel started programming when he was 12 years old, and jumped into the world of game development 
            doing game design and pixel art for Agent Z 2, a Palm Pilot game.<br><br>
          After honing his development skills with years of enterprise software development, the lure of creating his own games 
            grew too strong. With the help of his brother Noah Reinagel, Enigma Dragons was formed.<br><br>
          Silas is credited in multiple games, including BitVault, Delivery Time, Zero Footprint Society, and his favorite, Gnosis Disperitus.<br><br>
          His favorite titles include Chrono Trigger, Deus Ex, The Witness, and the Fire Emblem series.</p>

          <h3>Danillo Neves</h3>​

          <p>Danillo Neves has always been passionate about games. Since the first Nintendo 64 games he played at age 5, 
          he had always wondered how those games were made and how fun it would have been to make them.<br><br>

          Danillo studied computer engineering, focusing on software development. What he learned was then applied in 
          his game development journey. Until now, Danillo has participated in many projects, with Santa's Magic Night 
          being one of the his most serious contributions.<br><br>

          Danillo's dream is to have a highly passionate, professional team to develop the best games he can, with 
          the creative freedom he always imagined. With these games, he wishes to bring the best type of entertainment 
          to people all over the world.</p>
