          <h3>Silas Reinagel</h3>​
          <p>Silas Reinagel started programming when he was 12 years old, and jumped into the world of game development 
            doing game design and pixel art for Agent Z 2, a Palm Pilot game.<br><br>
          After honing his development skills with years of enterprise software development, the lure of creating his own games 
            grew too strong. With the help of his brother Noah Reinagel, Enigma Dragons was formed.<br><br>
          Silas is credited in multiple games, including BitVault, Delivery Time, Zero Footprint Society, and his favorite, Gnosis Disperitus.<br><br>
          His favorite titles include Chrono Trigger, Deus Ex, The Witness, and the Fire Emblem series.</p>
